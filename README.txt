This was an Operating Systems assignment. The purpose of this assignment was to provide better understanding of how operating systems schedule their processes. This code was written before the author had learned more advanced programming topics such as Design Patterns and thus may not be in optimal condition.

For the most part, the algorithms implemented here are faily straightforward except for the AG algorithm, which is a custom algorithm that involved combining different algorithms into a fairly complex one. For legal reasons, the instructor's file describing the algorithm can not be provided here, however, to briefly explain how this algorithm works, we shall say that each task queued to the scheduler is assigned an initial 'quantum' time which diminishes over time; depending on number of parameters (e.g the task's priority, time remaining,....) , the scheduler would choose an appropriate algorithm to execute.


This assignment was written in Java 8 was submitten on 9/12/2018 and was working as expected.
